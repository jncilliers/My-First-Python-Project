# My-First-Python-Project
This is my first Python project I am working on. The idea is to extract live bitcoin prices from Kraken, Bitstamp and Luno and see what percentage arbitrage opportunities exist between a South African exchange and other.

I am basically experimenting with API's and various Python modules. I am expecting that what I am doing is probably not the best, but for me it is a start.
